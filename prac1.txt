SQL queries using Insert, Select, Update, delete with operators, functions, and set operator etc.

1. INSERT Statement

INSERT INTO Employees (EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, Department, Salary)
VALUES (101, 'John', 'Doe', 'HR', 50000);

2. SELECT Statement with Conditions (WHERE, AND, OR, IN)

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Department
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR' AND Salary > 40000;

3. SELECT with Aggregate Functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)

SELECT Department, SUM(Salary) AS TotalSalary, AVG(Salary) AS AverageSalary
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;

4. SELECT with Functions (UPPER, LOWER, LENGTH)

SELECT UPPER(FirstName), LOWER(LastName), LENGTH(FirstName) AS NameLength
FROM Employees;

5. UPDATE Statement with Conditions

UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE Department = 'HR' AND Salary < 50000;

6. DELETE Statement with Conditions

DELETE FROM Employees
WHERE EmployeeID = 101;

7. Using Operators (LIKE, BETWEEN, IN)

LIKE Operator (pattern matching):

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE FirstName LIKE 'J%';
BETWEEN Operator (range of values):

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Salary
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 60000;
IN Operator (multiple values):

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department IN ('HR', 'IT');

8. SET Operators (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)

UNION (combine results of two queries):

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR'
UNION
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 60000;

INTERSECT (find common results):

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR'
INTERSECT
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 60000;

EXCEPT (exclude results from the second query):

SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Department = 'HR'
EXCEPT
SELECT FirstName, LastName
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 60000;
